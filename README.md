tracker
=========

tracker is a very soon to be renamed mobile web app to track financial transations in the fastest and easiest possible way. tracker uses PouchDB to create a local database in your browser, then when possible it syncs with a remote CouchDB. The sync works both ways so any transactions logged uisng the app will end up in all databases.
The goal of the project is to provide a simple interface to log spending independant of how the transaction was made (cash, credit, debit, etc.)
